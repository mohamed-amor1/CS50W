## Django

Django is a powerful web framework written in [Python](/wiki/Python) that enables the development of dynamic web applications. It follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern, emphasizing the principle of reusability and promoting efficient development practices.

Key features of Django include:

- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):** Django provides an abstraction layer over the database, allowing developers to interact with the database using Python objects.
- **URL Routing and View Handling:** Django's URL routing mechanism maps URLs to views, enabling the handling of HTTP requests and generating dynamic responses.
- **Template System:** Django's template engine enables the generation of dynamic [HTML](/wiki/HTML) pages by combining Python code with HTML templates.
- **Form Handling:** Django simplifies form handling, including form validation and processing, providing a convenient way to handle user input.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Django includes built-in tools for user authentication, session management, and access control.
- **Admin Interface:** Django provides an automatic admin interface that allows easy management of data models and content administration.

Django follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, promoting code reusability and reducing redundancy. Its extensive documentation, vibrant community, and wide range of third-party packages make it a popular choice for building robust web applications.

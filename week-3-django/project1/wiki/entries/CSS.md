## CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a powerful language used to add style, layout, and visual effects to an [HTML](/wiki/HTML) page. With CSS, you can:

- Customize the colors, fonts, and backgrounds of your web page.
- Position and align elements with precision.
- Create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.
- Add animations and transitions to make your page more interactive.

CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them. You can target elements by their tag names, class names, or IDs. CSS styles can be defined directly in the HTML file using the `<style>` tag or in a separate CSS file that is linked to the HTML.

By separating the presentation (CSS) from the structure (HTML), CSS provides a flexible and efficient way to design and maintain web pages.

To get started with CSS, you can refer to various resources and tutorials available online. Experimenting with different styles and techniques will help you unleash the full potential of CSS in creating visually appealing and engaging web pages.
